Why on Earth did I decide to join a full-time intensive data science program through Flatrion School after spending 4 years with the rapidly expanding company WeWork? The opportunities for personal growth at WeWork were boundless: the main product was expanding into new markets and countries on a monthly basis, year-over-year revenue growth was above 100%, and new employees were joining the company at an astronomical rate. Last I checked, WeWork was the fastest growing company in the world!

It was an incredible place to work. Every day was a challenge unique unto itself. It felt like every day was the day of any company's founding: fuzzy objectives, lack of clarity, intense energy, rapid pivots towards entirely new goals, et cetera. It was a classic start-up environment.

Further, WeWork pitched an internal culture built on respect, finding purpose in your work, personal growth, mandating positive impacts on the world, and pushing the envelope to achieve more than ever dreamed. It was a culture I admired, and one I would model my own company after should I ever start a business.
I was on the path to a promotion that would include a raise. The people I worked with, and for, were great. The company was great. Life was great.

So why, then, did I pull myself from that wheel of seemingly good fortune to join a full-time data science program?
Well, as it turns out, that's a great question. The answer to which is still unfolding. But let me provide some context that might offer some clarity behind my logic.

There are three items I can point to which have guided me to the here and now:

1) Personal Mission:

I once heard the COO of a large company discuss the importance of having a personal mission, much like a company would have its own guiding mission statement. It took several months before I fully began to appreciate that concept. What was my personal mission statement? Why is it so hard to draft a personal mission statement? What's the point of that anyway? As an employee, isn't my mission statement just to serve the company's mission statement using whatever skills and experience I bring to the table? Wrong.

Over time, I realized I didn't have a mission statement. Something guiding me through the stages of personal and professional development. As I began piecing together a mission statement using a combination of my interests, values, and skills, I developed something that can be summarized as the following: To build a career that sits at the intersection of technology, business, and positive contributions to the world.

2) Skill:


On the surface, my career journey would appear like a random walk through the jungle. I've had experience in management, sales, data analysis, finance, operationsâ€¦ the list is long for someone in their early 30's. But something that has always bothered me is this idea of being a generalist: someone who is good many things but lacks expertise in any one skill.

As a Project Manager at WeWork, I was just that. Someone who coordinated among different teams, missions, and skills to produce an output that met an objective. My job required me to be a driving force among the 'true' subject matter experts, not necessarily being one myself.
I have decided to change that. With this program, I am further expanding my skill set within data analytics/science, statistics, and by extension, machine learning.

3) Curiosity:


I am a curious person. Fascinated by many things, I can spend hours learning topics that do nothing but satisfy my intense appetite for understanding about the world around us. Here's the proof: Most nights, I fall asleep to a documentary running on my computer. I read books that range in topics from historical non-fiction, to politics, to physics, to business, and of course, to data science. I read Time magazine and military blogs. I'm a news junkie who frequents CNN, Bloomberg, and The Wall Street Journal to keep up on the world's events.
To me, data represents a domain that speaks the truth about the universe and the events within it. With data, we can ask questions and find objective answers. The prospect of asking questions about events, and finding answers about those events, fuels my curiosity.

If the language of math is an elegant description of how the physical world works, and periodicals represent the day to day drama of the human world, then data is the connection between the language of the universe and the events within it. And that is why data is so interesting to me.

Alas, I now venture in pursuit of my personal mission by further developing a technical skill set while fueling my curiosity in the hopes of positively impacting the world. These lines were written on April 15, 2019. It also happens to be the first day of the data science program in which I am enrolled, and the beginning of my data science journey.
