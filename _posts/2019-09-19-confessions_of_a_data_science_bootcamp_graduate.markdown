t's September 20, 2019. Graduation day for data science students at Flatiron school. It's also a day to reflect on the previous 6 months. A period of time riddled with elation, frustration, misery, and pride. While I valued the experience, and am happy with my decision to join the program, I'd be remiss if I said it was an enjoyable experience. 
Yes, parts of it were enjoyable. Getting to know my classmates and instructor, all of whom were great people, was a joy. Many of the topics covered in the course were incredibly interesting and aligned with my expectations and interests. But man, was the program hard! 
To those who have never gone through a coding boot camp, I offer this analogy to help illustrate the experience: A data science bootcamp, at least the one with Flatiron school, is equal parts mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, statistics),  coding (python, SQL), and general data science domain knowledge. Each part is a large topic taking perhaps years to master. When you sum these parts together it's analogous to a foreign language: the mathematics representing the sentence structure, code the written language and punctuation, and domain knowledge the meaning/definition behind each word. 
Knowing this, assume you find yourself in a unique situation in which you are tasked with giving a speech to the parliament of a foreign country having no prior education or experience with the local language. You're given 6 months to write and prepare the speech which is to be delivered live in front of the sitting members of parliament. The pressure would be immense. And failure is not an option for doing so would crater your aspirations of becoming the next ambassador to the country. 
Now, of course, the scenario here is extreme, and the pressure alone from public speaking would give some cause to exclaim nothing would be worse than giving a speech, but the underlying mechanics of would it would take to go from zero experience with a foreign language to writing and giving a speech in 6 months is akin to living inside a coding boot camp.

To those thinking of joining a data science bootcamp, I offer these survival tips: 
Move fast and learn as much as you can, but don't get bogged down and fall behind! If you do, you'll have a heck of a time trying to catch up. 
Rest assured that if you don't master or understand the concepts on the first go-around, it'll be easier to grasp and plug the knowledge gaps when you revisit the topic down the road. 
Try to enjoy it. Even when you're in the depths of despair and frustrated beyond belief, remember that you are doing this because the topic is of interest and your future relationship with data science is one you look forward to. If either of these doesn't apply to you, then perhaps reconsider your decision to join the program. 
Lean on your peers for emotional support. You'll need it. 
The ancillary educational content on the topics covered in the lessons and labs are your best friend. Buy some relevant books, watch some youtube tutorials, and 'google it'. You'll need these resources to help grasp some of the concepts.
